For Project 2, the 'Student Attendance Management System' enables users to perform essential tasks, including student registration and removal, attendance record updates, and checking individual students' attendance status. Additionally, the program offers the capability to save and load student information and attendance data, facilitating seamless, ongoing data management.
1. Arrays and vectors: This function manages student information and attendance records, utilizing efficient data structures to organize and manipulate the student list. This design supports storing and quickly retrieving information for a large number of students.
2. String: String handling in this program leverages both std::string and C-style strings to manage text data, such as student names and attendance dates. This approach facilitates efficient string manipulation, including search and modification functionality, as required.
3. Structures: Structures are utilized to define student information efficiently, encapsulating student ID, name, and attendance records to create a clear and organized data structure. An array of structures will be employed to manage data for multiple students, enabling streamlined handling and access to each student's information.
4. Pointers and dynamic memory management: Pointers and dynamic memory management will be implemented to optimize the program's handling of student data, ensuring efficient processing and flexible memory use as the data grows.
5. File I/O functions: File I/O functions will be implemented to enable saving and loading of student data and attendance records, ensuring data persistence between program sessions.
6. Code optimization and memory management: Code optimization and careful memory management techniques will be applied to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient program operation. Redundant code will be minimized, and streamlined algorithms will be employed to enhance overall performance.
7. Enumeration and smart pointers: Enumerations will be used to represent attendance statuses (e.g., present, tardy, absent), enhancing data readability and management efficiency by providing a clear and standardized way to handle different attendance types.
8. Bonus points: Additionally, the program will incorporate features for calculating attendance rates and performing statistical analysis, expanding its functionality to provide valuable insights into attendance patterns.
